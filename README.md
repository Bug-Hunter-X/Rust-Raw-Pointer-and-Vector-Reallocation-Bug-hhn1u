This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to raw pointers and vector reallocation.  The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code that leads to undefined behavior because it attempts to modify the vector through a raw pointer after the vector has been potentially reallocated.  The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a safer alternative, demonstrating how to properly handle memory and avoid this issue.
